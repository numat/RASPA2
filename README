RASPA 2011 (version 0.99)
========================

This software is a general purpose classical simulation package. It has been developed at
Northwestern University (Evanston, USA) during 2006-2011 in active collaboration 
with University Pablo de Olavide (Seville, Spain).
It can be used for the simulation of molecules in gases, fluids, zeolites, aluminosilicates,
metal-organic frameworks, carbon nanotubes and external fields.
It has incorporated most of the capacilities of DLPOLY, BIGMAC, BIGGERMAC, TINKER, MUSIC, GULP, and COTA.

Unique aspects of RASPA:
1) No other code has such an interwoven (MD, MC, Minimization) structure
2) Bond-dipoles implemented using Ewald
3) dynamically corrected Transition State Theory
4) flexible framework models
5) multiple systems with multiple frameworks


CAPABILITIES:
=============

The software has the following capabilities:

  [A] General
  ===========
   1) linear and branched (chiral) molecules
   2) a molecule can consist of rigid and flexible units (i.e. aromatics)
   3) general configurational-bias Monte Carlo (including intra molecular cross-terms potentials)
   4) over 50 molecules included, automatic generation of TraPPE molecules
   5) over 50 zeolites and metal-organic frameworks included
   6) NVT, muVT, NPT, and osmotic ensembles.
   7) fixed and flexible framework models
   8) multiple system (i.e. [hyper] parallel tempering)
   9) multiple frameworks per system (i.e. catenation in MOFS, clays, and slit-pores)
  10) tricubic grid interpolation for rigid frameworks
  11) many funtional forms for stretch, bend, (improper) torsion, stretch-stretch, stretch-bend, bend-bend,
      bend-torsion, stretch-torsion, and inversion-bends.
      compatible force fields:
        * MM2/MM3 (bond-dipoles)
        * TraPPE
        * OPLS (1-4 VDW and Coulomb scaling)

  13) Automatic computation of fugacity coefficients for single and multicomponents using e.g. Peng-Robinson
  14) Computation of analytical Hessian for mode analysis, normal-mode Monte-Carlo, minimization

  18) charges and bond-dipoles using Ewald summation
  19) calculation of:
      - radial distribution function
      - bond/bend/torsion distribution
      - principle moments of inertia
  20) (anamolous) scattering factors for neutral atoms and ions
  21) spline-fitting, used for Umbrella sampling and dcTST
  22) polarization using self-consistent iteration

  [B] Molecular Dynamics
  ======================
   1) linear and branched molecules
   2) NVE,NVT,NPT,NPT-PR ensembles
   3) Sympletic, measure preserving integration, quaternions for rigid units
   4) Thermo and Barostats: Nose-Hoover
   5) Automatic generation of non-overlapping initial configuration (upto very high densities)
   6) calculation of:
      - mean squared displacement (order-n algorithm) for self-and corrected diffusivity
   7) generation of pdb-movies
   8) Infrared (IR),Neutron-scattering (NS) spectra

  [C] Monte Carlo capabilities 
  ============================
   1) NVT, NPT, muVT, osmotic ensembles
   2) Configurational Bias Monte carlo (CBMC)
      - branches are handled correctly (all grown at the same time)
      - cbcm can handle very stiff potentials
      - cbcm can handle a large number of ligands
      - the stereo-chemistry can be specified
      - coupled-decoupled for torsion (there can be several torsions on the same bond)
   3) Automatic generation of non-overlapping initial configuration
   4) calculation of the Rosenbluth factors, Henry coefficients and heats of adsorption
   5) free energy profiles in nanoporous materials (for dynamically corrected transition state theory)
   6) adsorption in zeolites, metal-organic frameworks, and carbon nanotubes
   7) MC moves:
